The analysis's goal
This analysis's goal is to classify loan applicants according to their demographic and financial traits. You can find trends and divide applicants into different categories by doing this. These clusters might offer insightful information for financial institutions' risk assessment, focused marketing, customized loan offers, or decision-making.


Data's Financial Information and What Had to Be Forecasted

*Derogatory Marks: How many payments where not current or missing.

*DTI: A borrowers debt to income ratio.

* Number of accounts: How many accounts a borrower has currently.

*Loan Size: The total sum of funds that the applicant has asked for.

 * Borrower Income: The applicant's annual income may have an impact on their capacity to repay the loan.

*Credit Score: A figure that indicates how creditworthy an application is.

*Interest Rate: The pace at which interest is accrued on a loan.
	A ratio that contrasts the applicant's monthly debt payments with their monthly income is called the debt-to-income ratio, or DTI.

In conclusion
I was able to find twoÂ loan data segments by grouping loan applicants according to their demographic and financial traits. Financial organizations can use this segmentation to target particular applicant groups with customized offerings, evaluate risk, and personalize lending products.
